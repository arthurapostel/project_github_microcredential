# Micro-credentials Project

You should **fork this repository** and in collaboration with a colleague that is also part of the micro-credential course, you need to develop the project.
The project is simple, and consists of creating a repository for documenting concepts, best practices, examples and commands-guide on using Git & GitHub.

You repository must contain a **folder structure, a README file, a gitignore file**. All files must be developed in markdown (MD), you can find more information about [MD here](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) and about [Liascript](https://liascript.github.io/) flavour of MD. You can add images and printscreen if you want.

<span style="color:mediumBlue"> **Think about and inform yourself via internet resources about a useful folder structure in the repository**.</span>

    c. You can merge directly or using branch pull request if you want someone to review

2. A minimum of 10 commits per person must be seen in the history.

3. You need to have at least to solved conflicts in the history, one by each person.

4. You need to revert at least on commit.

# Micro-credentials Project

You should fork this repository and in collaboration with a colleague in the same course you need to develop the project.
The project is simple, and consists of creating a repository for documenting concepts related to Git & GitHub, a cheat-sheet with commands to use the command line, a README file, a gitignore file. All files must be developed in markdown.

Both parties should work in different branches, and deliver the final merged version. Once with the final version you must make a pull request to this repository.
You are encouraged to create issues to communicate to each other about the development. 

Think about and inform yourself via internet resources about a useful folder structure in the repository.

# Micro-credentials Project

If you found this repository and is not registered in [our micro-credential]() please read more in the last topic.

You should **fork this repository** and in collaboration with a colleague that is also part of the micro-credential course, you need to develop the project.
The project is simple, and consists of creating a repository for documenting concepts, best practices, examples and commands-guide on using Git & GitHub.

You repository must contain a **folder structure, a README file, a gitignore file**. All files must be developed in markdown (MD), you can find more information about [MD here](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) and about [Liascript](https://liascript.github.io/) flavour of MD. You can add images and printscreen if you want.

    c. You can merge directly or using branch pull request if you want someone to review

2. A minimum of 10 commits per person must be seen in the history.

3. You need to have at least to solved conflicts in the history, one by each person.

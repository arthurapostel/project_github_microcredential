# Micro-credentials Project

Hi! We are Adrien and Arthur and this our amazing GitHub project, where we show we've totally mastered all the cool Git and Github stuff we recently learned about.

In particular,
- we **forked this repo** and **collaborate on the same forked repo**
- we created a **cheat-sheet markdown file with examples**
- our repo contains a **folder**, a **README file**, a **gitignore file**, and a **license**
- we worked with **3 different brnaches**

We might have been a tiny bit more ambition by adding
- internet resources we've used to think about our impressive folder structure

We definitely need to
- **merge all branches** for the final version
-

# Welcome to our file explaining the different concepts we used on this project

## Here are some examples of what we did 
After Arthur forked and cloned the original, he created his own branch :

`git branch Arthur`  

Then proceeded to commit some changes:

`git add cheat_sheet`
`git commit -m "Added cheat sheet md and some initial info"`

After some other commits and conflict creation it was now time to merge his branch w/ the main one (from the main one):

`git merge Arthur`

But "oh oh", some massive conflict emerged. It was now time to decide which changes were the most relevant to keep before adding and commiting again!

## But how did we do all that ? Well here is the knowledge needed.
First we both cloned the forked repository, using :
`git clone <SSH key>`
--> Cloning means that we're making a local copy of a repository from github.

Do we need git init again? 
--> No because :
    - .git folder is already created
